A scrapper for the 2021 Chicago Marathon is available in `Scrape Data.ipynb`. Running this notebook will prepare an output file named `all_runners_with_splits.csv`

### 3. Run Analysis

You can run the analyze yourself using `Analyze Data.ipynb`.

## Run it yourself

The input format is a CSV file with run runner per row and column for each split. You can see example CSV file is here.
